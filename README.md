## 🌟 Motivations

The creation of this project was driven by three core pillars:

1.  **Nostalgia & Passion:** As lifelong fans of _The Simpsons_, we wanted to build a tool that goes beyond a simple wiki. We envisioned a place where the community could interact with the show's vast universe in a more personal way.
2.  **Technical Excellence:** This project serves as a playground for the latest web technologies. Implementing **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, and **Tailwind CSS 4** allows us to explore the cutting edge of performance, server-side rendering, and modern styling.
3.  **Open Source Community:** By licensing this project as open source, we aim to provide a robust template for other developers to build fan-driven companion apps, fostering a culture of sharing and collaborative learning.
